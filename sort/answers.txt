sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: For sorted data merge sort has the a much faster run time than selection sort for sorted data because it takes only 1 iteration over the entire data (say containing n elements ) in contast to n for selection sort.
sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: for random data set the running time for the merge sort is the least because its big O of n running time is O(nlogn) which is much faster in comparision to the O(n^2) run time of selection and bubble sort

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: has similar run time to bubble sort for random sized data but much slower than merge sort. Selection sort is much slower than bubble sort for sorted data.
